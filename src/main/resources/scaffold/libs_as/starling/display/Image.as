    /** An Image is a quad with a texture mapped onto it.
     *  
     *  <p>The Image class is the Starling equivalent of Flash's Bitmap class. Instead of 
     *  BitmapData, Starling uses textures to represent the pixels of an image. To display a 
     *  texture, you have to map it onto a quad - and that's what the Image class is for.</p>
     *  
     *  <p>As "Image" inherits from "Quad", you can give it a color. For each pixel, the resulting  
     *  color will be the result of the multiplication of the color of the texture with the color of 
     *  the quad. That way, you can easily tint textures with a certain color. Furthermore, images 
     *  allow the manipulation of texture coordinates. That way, you can move a texture inside an 
     *  image without changing any vertex coordinates of the quad. You can also use this feature
     *  as a very efficient way to create a rectangular mask.</p>

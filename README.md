# Flair Gradle Plugin
Flair is a [gradle](http://gradle.org/) plugin that help you build **Adobe AIR projects** (ios, android and desktop). Flair comes up with all tasks you may already use with Ant (compile, install, launch, etc...) but also with all files you need to start working on your projects. Last but not least Flair greatly **improves resource management** using an [Android like](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html) approach.

#####FEATURES :
* Comes up with latest stable version of **[Starling](https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework)** and **[Feathers](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathers)** (as actionscript libraries)
* Almost transparent Flair actionscript library to **manage your resources**
* Once you're set up you'll be able to compile/test a **template project**
* **[TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) plugin** to autogenerate your atlases when compiling
* **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) plugin** to allow using standard run/debug configuration from IDEA
* And more ([**Flair logger**](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/flair-logger), **asdoc** generation , **R class** auto generated resource class as Android, ...)

# Flair Gradle Plugin
Flair is a [gradle](http://gradle.org/) plugin that help you build Adobe AIR mobile/desktop projects with [Starling](https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework) and [Feathers](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathers) libraries. Flair also comes up with its own actionscript library to manage your app resources, it actually mimics [Android resources managment](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html).

###WARNING
This plugin is designed to work with [**IntelliJ IDEA**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), it won't work as expected with other IDE, i may consider adding other IDE support (Flash Builder, FDT) if sufficient requests are made for them.
